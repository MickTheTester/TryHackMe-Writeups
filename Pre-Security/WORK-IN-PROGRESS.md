# Work in Progress â€” TryHackMe Learning Roadmap
**Owner:** MickTheTester

---

## Current status
- âœ… TryHackMe account created (username: `MickTheTester`)
- ðŸ”œ First lab to do: **Pre-Security** (beginner path)
- ðŸ“Œ Repository purpose: document progress, publish writeups, and host tools/scripts

---

## Short-term plan (next 2 weeks)
1. Complete **Pre-Security** path on TryHackMe â€” capture nmap output and 1 screenshot.
2. Publish `Pre-Security/PreSecurity.md` with commands, notes, and screenshots.
3. Complete one intermediate lab (e.g., Vulnversity) and publish a writeup.
4. Create a small Python script (port scanner or log parser) and add it to a `Python-Tools` repo.

---

## How I'll document each lab
Each lab folder will contain:
- `<LabName>.md` â€” the writeup (TL;DR, Commands, Exploit steps, Mitigations, Lessons)
- `notes/` â€” redacted screenshots and helper scripts
- `README.md` â€” quick lab summary
