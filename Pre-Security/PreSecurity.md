# Lab: Pre-Security
**Author:** MickTheTester  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Status:** In Progress

---

## TL;DR
Starting the Pre-Security path on TryHackMe. This file is a live log — I'll update it with commands, outputs, and screenshots once I run the lab on the VM.

---

## Planned steps to record
- Run reconnaissance: `nmap -sC -sV -oN nmap_basic.txt <TARGET_IP>`
- Test connectivity: `ping -c 3 <TARGET_IP>`
- Basic system checks on target (when applicable): `whoami && id && uname -a`
- Capture 1–3 screenshots (nmap output, one successful task)

---

## Current notes
- TryHackMe account created (username: `MickTheTester`)
- Next lab to run: Pre-Security (beginner path)
- Date started: `<TBD>`
